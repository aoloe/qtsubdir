# qtsubdir

This is a repository for testing how to get the .pro file straight with a slightly complex set of subdirs projects

We are going to create a dummy Qt Project that is creating a console Qt Application that is reading a text file.

There will be:

- a console application,
- a "loadTxt" plugin,
- a `mylib` library that exposes some functionality to both the application and the plugin.

- [Creating the project structure](documentation/01_project_creation.md)
